		<h6>Results and Discussions</h6>
		<p>Following the described methods, I have assembled monthly CO2 emissions estimates for coal, oil, natural gas, and cement for India (Fig. 1). The available data and methodology allow for the estimation of emissions from coal from September 2008, oil from April 1998, natural gas from January 2009, and cement from April 2001.

Emissions from oxidation of coal form the largest share of the total, rising from about 61% in 2010 to 66% in 2014, before levelling off to about 65% in 2019. Peak monthly emissions to date were in March 2019 with 157Mt CO2 in the month. While emissions from coal grew at an average rate of 6.2%yr−1 over 2009–2018, in 2019 they stalled, as electricity demand dropped dramatically (Fig. S41 in the Supplement).

Emissions from oxidation of oil (petroleum products) are the next-largest source with about 25% of the total, reaching 50–60Mt CO2 per month in recent years. Emissions from natural gas and cement production are both about 5% of the total.
While the monthly emissions series appear quite volatile, X-11 seasonality analysis (Darné et al., 2018; Shiskin et al., 1967; summarised in the Supplement) reveals strong, underlying seasonal patterns (Fig. 2). Coal emissions reach a peak in March–May, before declining by up to 10 % below the trend line for the typical southwest monsoon months of June–August and then picking up again towards the end of the year, and emissions from both oil and cement show similar though somewhat less smooth patterns. These emissions patterns largely result from the effects of the monsoon's heavy rains, driving a decline in industrial, construction, and transportation activities. Coal emissions are also driven down by the displacing effect of higher power generation from both hydropower and wind during the monsoon season. In addition, oil emissions exhibit a consistent dip in January and in March–April. Natural gas emissions show a substantially lower amplitude of seasonality, under ± 5 %, with recent years showing a peak during the monsoon, apparently driven by increased fertiliser production during these months. The seasonality of natural gas emissions is also less stable over time, as supply constraints have changed considerably. Despite relatively clear derived seasonal signals, considerable volatility is superimposed on this seasonality in all emissions series (Fig. 1).

Turning to calendar-year emissions, Table 1 summarises emissions by category and total CO2 emissions for India from 2009 to 2019. Each category has grown by 3 %–5 % per year over the last 5 years, although growth from year to year has not been smooth, with coal emissions stable in 2019. Total CO2 emissions in India have grown from 1.6 Gt in 2009 to 2.6 Gt in 2019, at an annual growth rate of 3.9 %. (An equivalent table for financial‐year emissions is presented in the Supplement.) Over the same period, the CO2 emissions intensity of India's GDP has declined from 23.2 to 18.1 g per Indian rupee, about 2.2 % yr−1 (Fig. S40 in the Supplement).

The monthly Indian fossil CO2 emissions dataset produced here includes all but about 2 % of anthropogenic fossil sources in the country, excluding emissions from decomposition of fossil carbonates in the production of lime, glass, and ceramics. The time lags of the emissions estimates are at most 2 months, and under 1 month for coal, the most important emissions source.
