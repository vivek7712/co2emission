		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>As the world rapidly approaches the temperature limits set in the Paris Agreement (CONSTRAIN, 2019), timely estimates of greenhouse gas emissions are critical for steering policy and scientific understanding of the global carbon cycle (Le Quéré et al., 2020). India, although having low per capita emissions, is the world's third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide (Friedlingstein et al., 2019), yet its most recent official report of emissions covers the single year 2014 (GOI, 2018).

According to available estimates, India's CO2 emission have grown over 2010–2018 (Crippa et al., 2019). This growth has mainly been driven by expansion of the economy as, among other things, the country's labour pool grows and much-needed energy supply is increased (Karstensen et al., 2020), and much of this energy is supplied by coal and petroleum products, including the transition from biomass to petroleum fuels, continuing the long-term increase in the share of India's energy supplied from fossil fuels (see Fig. S42 in the Supplement). Countering these upward pressures on CO2 emissions, India's recent development of variable renewables, particularly solar and wind, has exerted a downward pressure on emissions growth, assisted by a sharp decline in prices for these technologies and ambitious goals for renewables growth that have repeatedly been strengthened (Khanna, 2010; MNRE, 2015; Varadhan, 2019). Development of variable renewables has been further assisted by the introduction of reverse auctions and the creation of solar parks, among other measures (Bose and Sarkar, 2019). In addition, the difficulty India has faced in ramping up domestic coal production has probably also restrained emissions growth (Carl, 2015).

India does publish a great deal of energy data, but it is scattered across many documents, often not in machine-readable form, occasionally with errors, and generally without much documentation. The country's official estimates of CO2 emissions are infrequent and never for more than a single year (GOI, 2004, 2012, 2015, 2018). Moreover, these reported emissions are for India's financial year, running from April to March, so they do not align with the calendar-year estimates provided by almost every other country (Andrew, 2020b). This gap in official reporting has been filled by third parties estimating emissions largely based on available financial-year publications, whether directly or via intermediate sources (e.g. IEA, 2019a; Gilfillan et al., 2019; EIA, 2020; Hoesly et al., 2018; GHG Platform India, 2020), and not all of these are freely available.

Given the rapid pace both of India's development and of the change in global context, emissions estimates at a frequency greater than annual are also of interest. Higher-frequency data open up opportunities to analyse the relationships between emissions and policy shifts, economic cycles, weather, and more. The ability to explain why emissions have changed is critical to developing effective emissions policies.

Many of India's energy data are not available in formats that are readily machine-readable. In many cases, tables must be copied from PDF-format reports, either automatically using “scraping” scripts or by hand. On some occasions, reports posted on official websites are low-quality scans of signed documents, further reducing the availability of these data for analysis. Furthermore, explanations for data are often lacking in detail and can conflict across different datasets for reasons that are not immediately apparent (see Sect. S7 in the Supplement).

The International Energy Agency in 2020 stated that the “Government of India should … Improve the collection, consistency, transparency and availability of energy data across the energy system at central and state government levels” (IEA, 2020b, p. 18). While government ministries responsible for publishing these data are making moves to improve the availability of more recent data, there are still obvious examples of copy-and-paste errors in spreadsheets, random misspellings, filename glitches, and even incorrect units given in the Energy Statistics yearbook (MOSPI, 2019). During the COVID-19 lockdown in India, the Central Electricity Authority stopped publishing daily generation reports for 4 weeks. Clearly much data work is still manual, and further automation will significantly improve India's ability to produce robust and timely estimates of fossil CO2 emissions.

Monthly emissions estimates are also a core input to atmospheric-inversion models (Oda et al., 2018). The standard approach taken in the literature to produce monthly emissions estimates is to use a temporal profile based on partial monthly activity data to temporally downsample annual emissions estimates. Three examples of this downsampling approach in the literature are the very first seasonal estimates made by Rotty (1987), CDIAC's gridded estimates (Andres et al., 2011), and EDGAR's temporal profiles (Crippa et al., 2020). Rotty (1987) and Andres et al. (2011), for example, used coal-fired power generation as a proxy for all coal consumption in India, while Crippa et al. (2020) used a proprietary database of activity data. EDGAR's monthly gridded dataset has no intra-annual variation for India (Matthew Jones, personal communication, 10 July 2020).

Here I present a new dataset collating available information on India's monthly energy production and consumption, as well as on cement production, and use this dataset directly to estimate India's monthly and calendar-year CO2 emissions. In contrast to downsampling techniques, the method used here provides accurate estimates of monthly CO2 emissions in India.
