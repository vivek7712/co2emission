		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>India is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies, but it also faces significant challenges related to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and climate change. The country's CO2 emissions primarily come from the burning of fossil fuels for energy, industrial processes, transportation, and agriculture. As India's population and economy continue to expand, so do its emissions. The Indian government has taken various steps to address this issue, including promoting renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, and implementing policies to reduce emissions from industries. Despite these efforts, India's CO2 emissions remain a concern, and finding sustainable solutions is crucial to combating climate change on a global scale.

		<h3>Literature review on co2 emissions</h3>
		<p>As a significant emitter of greenhouse gases, but also as a developing country starting from a low emissions base, India is an important actor in global climate change mitigation. However, perceptions of India vary widely, from an energy-hungry climate deal-breaker to a forerunner of a low carbon future. Developing clarity on India's energy and emissions future is challenged by the uncertainties of India's development transitions, including its pathway through a demographic and urban transition within a rapidly changing policy context. Model-based scenario analyses provide widely varying projections, in part because they make differing assumptions, often implicit, about these transitions. To address the uncertainty in India's energy and emissions future, this letter applies a novel interpretive approach to existing scenario studies. First, we make explicit the implied development, technology and policy assumptions underlying model-based analysis in order to cluster and interpret results. In a second step, we analyse India's current policy landscape and use that as a benchmark against which to judge scenario assumptions and results. Using this interpretive approach, we conclude that, based on current policies, a doubling of India's CO2 energy-related emissions from 2012 levels is a likely upper bound for its 2030 emissions and that this trajectory is consistent with meeting India's Paris emissions intensity pledge. Because of its low emissions starting point, even after a doubling, India's 2030 per capita emissions will be below today's global average and absolute emissions will be less than half of China's 2015 emissions from the same sources. The analysis of recent policy trends further suggests a lower than expected electricity demand and a faster than expected transition from coal to renewable electricity. The letter concludes by making an argument for interpretive approaches as a necessary complement to scenario analysis, particularly in rapidly changing development contexts.

		<h4>Emission estimate</h4>
		<p>
			World is now moving towards measuring emissions in the real world when vehicles are driven. For the real driving emissions (RDE) tests, the European Commission, the United States and China suggest that the driving cycles and laboratory tests do not reflect the likely emissions during real driving conditions, which are more complex than laboratory driving cycles. 

RDE is an independent test to overcome the limitations of WLTP and equivalent laboratory tests. A car is driven on public roads over a wide range of conditions.

Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) Equipment is installed on the vehicle that collects data to verify legislative caps for pollutants such as NOx, PN, etc. RDE tests are slowly becoming mandatory.

International Centre for Automotive Technology in India is currently developing RDE procedures that are likely to come into force in 2023.

The RDE cycle must account for conditions prevailing in the country, such as low and high altitudes, year-round temperatures, additional vehicle payload, up and downhill driving, urban and rural roads and highways. 

The critical issue in the RDE test is the appropriate Conformity Factors (CF) to account for measurement uncertainty of on-board equipment when compared to laboratory tests.

The CF is ‘not to exceed limit’ that considers a margin for error present simply because the PEMS equipment does not deliver precisely the same results for each test. 

The results of the RDE emissions for the entire RDE trip should remain below the ‘not to exceed’ emissions limits.

		<h5>Materials and methods</h5>
		<p>Emissions from the transport sector depend mainly on type of transport and fuel apart from type of combustion engine, emission mitigation techniques, maintenance procedures and vehicle age. The major pollutant emitted from transport are Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Carbon monoxide (CO), Nitrogen oxides (NOx), Nitrous oxide (N2O), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), Particulate matter (PM) and Hydrocarbon (HC). Diesel is used in public passenger and cargo vehicles, while private two wheelers, light motor vehicles (passenger), car and jeeps use gasoline. In the National capital, Delhi, most of the buses and omni buses and 5% of total cars and jeeps use Compressed Natural Gas.</p>

		<h6>Results and Discussions</h6>
		<p>Measurement and quantifications of GHG’s from transport sector is essential for a very fast developing economy like India, in order to design and implement suitable technologies and policies with the appropriate mitigation measures.State and sectorwise inventory of number of vehicles, type and amount of fuel used, age of vehicle is important to develop strategies at regional levels for GHG reduction.  Hence an attempt is made to compile these information from various government agencies for GHG emission inventory estimates. However, for railways and aviation sectors, only fuel consumption is available at the National level, which has been used to quantify emissions.Indian road transport contributes a significant quantities of 243.82 Tg CO2 (94.5%) and smaller quantities of CO, CH4, NOx, SO2, HC and PM. CO2 emission in the road sector, quantified based on 2003-04 data, is given in Fig. 2a. This illustrates that industrially and economically advanced states (Maharastra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu) contribute maximum compared to other states and average emission for the country is 6.97 Tg. Among the states and UT, Maharashtra’s contribution is the largest, 28.85 Tg (11.8%) of CO2, followed by Tamil Nadu 26.41 Tg (10.8%), Gujarat 23.31 Tg (9.6%), Uttar Pradesh 17.42 Tg (7.1%), Rajasthan 15.17 Tg (6.22%) and Karnataka 15.09 Tg (6.19%). The total of these six states accounts for 51.8 % of the CO2 emissions from road transport.  Total CO2 emission from road transport in year 2003-04 is approximately 2.3 times more than in comparison to year 2000 emission.   CO, CH4, NOx, SO2, HC emissions and PM is given in Fig.2b to Fig.2g. This shows average statewise emission of CO, CH4, NOx, SO2, HC and PM are 3.62, 63.25, 20.26, 20.67 and 4.37 Gg, respectively. The result further confirms that Gujarat, Maharastra and Tamil Nadu have higher proportion of emissions of CO, CH4, NOx, SO2, HC and PM.</p>

		<h7>Conclusion</h7>
		<p>In India, number of vehicles and there consequent emissions were different for each of the state or UT. Therefore, a decentralized emission inventories were prepared for road transport sector in order to design and implement suitable technologies and policies for appropriate GHG mitigation measures. First time an attempt has been made to calculate decentralized or statewise road transport emission of India, using number of different categories of vehicles and region specific mass emission factors and a country level emission were calculated for shipping, railways and aviation, using different type of fuel consumption.  The total CO2 emission for Indian transport was 258.10 Tg in 2003-04. Among all type of transport, road and aviation were first and second major contributor of air pollution. The road transport sector has contributed 94.5% and 53.3% of total transport emission of CO2 and CO. Among all the states and UT, Maharashtra’s contribution is the largest, 28.85 Tg (11.8%) of CO2, followed by Tamil Nadu 26.41 Tg (10.8%), Gujarat 23.31 Tg (9.6%), Uttar Pradesh 17.42 Tg (7.1%), Rajasthan 15.17 Tg (6.22%) and, Karnataka 15.09 Tg (6.19%). The total of these six states accounts for 51.8 % of the CO2 emissions from road transport. The aviation has contributed 2.9% and 45.1% of CO2 and CO of total transport emission. Shipping is most environment friendly mode of transport. It has contributed only 0.6% of CO2 emission, while railways have contributed 2.0% and 1.2% of CO2 and CO of total transport emission. For aviation, railways and shipping, emissions were also calculated for 2004-05 and 2005-06. Total emission of CO2 from railways, shipping and aviation has increased by 24.2% from 14.29 Tg in 2003-04 to 17.74 Tg in 2005-06. Similarly CO and CH4 emissions have increased from 32.3% and 31.8%, respectively.</p>
