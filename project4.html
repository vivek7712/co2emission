		<h5>Materials and methods</h5>
		<p>
			Fossil CO2 emissions can be divided into four main source categories: coal, oil, natural gas, and carbonates (Friedlingstein et al., 2019). For the fossil fuels, estimates of monthly consumption are required, while for carbonates, production statistics are needed. In all cases, apparent energy consumption approximates true consumption, omitting some minor changes in stocks. For example, reported consumption of petroleum products is most likely supply to the market, with stocks at petrol stations and in vehicles not accounted for. A summary of the methodology is presented here, while full details are provided in the Supplement, including a table of individual data sources.

While monthly coal consumption by utility power stations is reported (CEA, 2020), India does not report sub-annual total coal consumption, and apparent consumption must therefore be calculated using data on production, imports, exports, and stock changes. While these data are incomplete, they are sufficient to produce a reasonable estimate of monthly coal consumption. Importantly, the goal of this analysis is an estimate of CO2 emissions from all oxidation of solid fossil fuels, rather than the more limited emissions from combustion for energy purposes, and this means it is unnecessary to separate out, for example, coking coal used in steel manufacture, which is oxidised rather than combusted.

The energy data sources used include revised, historical data from the Indian Bureau of Mines (2019), Ministry of Coal (2020a), and UN Statistics Division (2020); provisional and revised data from Coal India Limited (CIL, 2020), Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL, 2020), the Ministry of Coal (2020b, 2020c), and the Ministry of Mines (Ministry of Mines, 2020); power station stocks from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA, 2020a, b); and international trade from the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS, 2020) and Department of Commerce (DOC, 2020), supplemented by recent provisional estimates reported by the media. While these data sources combined allow for a good estimate of production and stock changes in hard coal with a lag of less than 1 month, lignite production data have a slightly longer lag, and simple extrapolation is used to complete the picture for the most recent month or 2 months (Fig. S15 in the Supplement). It is assumed that the share of consumed coal that is not oxidised is negligible.
Monthly data on production and consumption of petroleum products are available from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. In all four categories, revised data are always used when available in preference to provisional data. Since consumption data are available, the apparent consumption approach used for coal is not required for petroleum products. All products except for bitumen and lubricants are assumed to be fully oxidised; while it is known that some naphtha is used for production of durable commodities, this share is not known but may be discoverable using data from the Annual Survey of Industries (MOSPI, 2020b).

PPAC also publishes monthly data on production, import, and supply of natural gas (PPAC, 2020a, b). Some data on consumption by sector are also published, and these are used to estimate the proportion of natural gas that is oxidised.

For carbonates, monthly data on clinker production are not available, so monthly cement production statistics are combined with a time-varying estimate of the clinker ratio to produce an estimate of monthly clinker production. Data on production of lime, glass, and ceramics were not available, and emissions from these carbonate sources are therefore omitted; India's second Biennial Update Report indicates these emissions combined contributed 1.9 % of fossil CO2 emissions in 2013/14 (GOI, 2018).

Once monthly energy consumption and clinker production estimates are available, these are converted to estimates of CO2 emissions. For fossil fuels this requires first converting the consumption in physical units to energy units using information from the International Energy Agency (IEA) for coal and petroleum products (IEA, 2019b, c) and PPAC (2020c) for natural gas and then applying emission factors from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2006 guidelines (Gómez et al., 2006). For clinker production, the method of Andrew (2019) is followed to estimate emissions from physical production in tonnes.

For complete details of the methodology, data sources used, comparisons of provisional and revised energy data, comparisons of energy data from different sources, and more, see the Supplement. The monthly energy and cement data collated here are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3894394 (Andrew, 2020a).
